In this file I have given detailed explanation of what is devops and devops lifecycle.
 DevOps lifecycle as a holistic “7C” phase approach: 

1.Continuous development
2.Continuous integration
3.Continuous testing
4.Continuous deployment/Continuous delivery
5.Continuous feedback
6.Continuous monitoring
7.Continuous operations
